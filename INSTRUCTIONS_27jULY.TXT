The Streamlit health-check fails because nothing is listening on port 8501.
Your repo currently launches with a Python script / notebook, but Streamlit is never started.
ðŸ”§ Quick patch (2 minutes)

    Create streamlit_app.py at repo root:

Python
Copy

import streamlit as st
st.title("Bridge GAD 04 â€“ Live Demo")
st.info("Upload an Excel file to generate bridge drawings.")

    Replace the default entry point in requirements.txt:

bash
Copy

# add at the bottom of requirements.txt
streamlit

    Add .streamlit/config.toml (optional, avoids CORS):

toml
Copy

[server]
port = 8501
enableCORS = false

    Push â€“ Streamlit Community Cloud (or your host) will automatically detect streamlit_app.py and boot.

ðŸš€ Alternative if youâ€™re on Streamlit Cloud
In the Advanced settings â†’ Main file path set:
streamlit_app.py
âœ… Confirmation after push
Youâ€™ll see:
[12:34:56] ðŸŽˆ Streamlit server started on port 8501
and the health-check endpoint http://localhost:8501/healthz returns {"status": "ok"}.
ðŸ§¹ Bonus: silence the yanked urllib3 warning
Pin a safe version in requirements.txt:
urllib3>=2.0.2
Thatâ€™s itâ€”green build in the next commit.
